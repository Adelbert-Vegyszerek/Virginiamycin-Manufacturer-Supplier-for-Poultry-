In the dynamic world of poultry farming, ensuring optimal health and performance of birds is crucial for productivity and profitability. At Adelbert Vegyszerek, we are committed to providing high-quality Virginiamycin, a powerful antibiotic widely used in poultry nutrition to enhance growth, prevent infections, and improve feed efficiency.
What is Virginiamycin?
Virginiamycin is a potent antimicrobial agent primarily used in poultry feed to control bacterial infections and promote gut health. It is effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens, which is a major cause of necrotic enteritis in poultry. By preventing bacterial overgrowth, Virginiamycin supports better digestion, improved nutrient absorption, and overall flock well-being.

Enhanced Feed Efficiency – Supports better digestion and nutrient utilization, leading to cost-effective poultry production.
